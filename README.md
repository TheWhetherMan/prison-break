## Release History

```
v1.0
Game constructed and known bugs fixed.

v2.0
Game reformatted with user-interactable questions, music, and scrolling 3D intro text.

v2.1
Flame effects added, colors changed, color of platforms switched, platform raise sound effect added.

v2.5b
Scoring system implemented, shows player/penguin scores after clicking "No" to another game.
Need to fine tune the camera movement onto the score numbers as well as fix a bug with the scorekeeper.

v2.5
Minor overlook in coding caused the scorekeeper not to track wins/losses if the person chose to continue a new game.

v2.6
3D scoretable discarded in exchange for simpler method.
Scores will now print in the bottom text box if the user chooses "No" to continue another game.
*Note: There seems to be a bug in Alice causing the scorekeeper to print "nu11*.0" with the asterisk being the score tally.
